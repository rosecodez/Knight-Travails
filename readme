Knight-Travails
Your task is to build a function knightMoves that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way. There is no need to create a GUI.

A knight in chess can move to any square on the standard 8x8 chess board from any other square on the board, given enough turns. Its basic move is two steps forward and one step to the side or one step forward and two steps to the side. It can face any direction.
Difficulties:
- the most difficult part was writing all the possible "L-Shaped" moves the knight can take
Odin Project mentions at the beginning a link to Computer science theory - graphs. The exercises helped a lot to understand how the representation of the graphs work.
I have used:
- `helper method` to make sure the `squares are on the board`;
- `enqueue` new node and add in `queue` array;
- `queue` array;
- `visited` array;
- `path` array;
- `shift` first node from queue and set as `currentNode`
- `push` children of `currentNode` into queue
- until the queue is empty and all nodes have been visited
